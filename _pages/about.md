I am a final year student at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Integrated Ciruits and Systems.

Currently, I am involved in research with the [Nano-scale Computing Devices Group](https://nanomemorylogic.wordpress.com/), with professor [Udayan Ganguly](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/udayan). Through the exploration of device physics, intricate design, and precise fabrication, we are actively engaged in advancing the realm of advanced computing. Our primary approach involves harnessing the unique properties of new materials and the underlying physics inherent in nano-scale devices. 

Amidst the boundless expanses of research, I have developed a fervent fascination for [Logotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy), a profound school of thought that explores the human search for meaning and purpose in life. In the quest for comprehending the intricacies of human belief systems and behavioral science, I find myself drawn to explore the [schools of philosophy](https://bigthink.com/thinking/10-schools-of-philosophy-and-why-you-should-know-them/). The intricate tapestry of human existence, woven with diverse threads of thought, beckons me to unravel its complexities.
