Hello! and welcome to my corner of the internet:D

I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). My research focuses on BEOL oxide-channel and ferroelectric devices for monolithic rogenous 3D integration, advised by [Prof. Shimeng Yu](https://shimeng.ece.gatech.edu/professor/) at the [Laboratory for Emerging Circuits and Devices](https://shimeng.ece.gatech.edu/).

During my undergraduate program, I specialized in Nanoelectronics and Integrated Ciruits, at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering. 

I was involved in research with the [MeLoDe (Memory Logic Device and Design)](https://nanomemorylogic.wordpress.com/) group, with [Prof. Udayan Ganguly](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/udayan) and [Prof. Veeresh Deshpande](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/veeresh-deshpande/). My Dual Degree thesis was based on BEOL compatible ITO transistor fabrication and modeling for monolithic 3D integration, where I fabricated some cool ITO transistors. Earlier I worked on TCAD modeling of GF32nm SOI MOSFET for application in band-to-band tunneling neuron. Besides, I worked on the integration of variability-aware process and aging degradation device-to-circuit degradation in CARAT, under the guidance of [Prof. Souvik Mahapatra](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/souvik). 

Amidst the boundless expanses of academic research, I have developed a fervent fascination for [Logotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy). In the quest for comprehending the intricacies of human belief systems and behavioral science, I find myself drawn to delve into the [schools of philosophy](https://bigthink.com/thinking/10-schools-of-philosophy-and-why-you-should-know-them/).

<h2><strong>Research</strong> Interests</h2>
An enduring fascination with nanoscale devices fuels my profound academic passion for nanoelectronics, device physics, and modeling.
I am interested in designing and fabrication of novel devices with accurate modeling, for efficient device-to-circuit system level translation.
