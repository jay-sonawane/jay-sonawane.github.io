I am a final year student at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Integrated Ciruits and Systems.

Currently, I am involved in research with the [Nano-scale Computing Devices Group](https://nanomemorylogic.wordpress.com/), with professor [Udayan Ganguly](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/udayan). 

Seekers on this planet want to unmask the answer to the three lettered monosyllabic word that's capable of making anything and everything that feels like the rock of your foundation start to become slippery; no not "Jay", its "Why". In search of this why and wherefore of things...

Amidst the boundless expanses of research, I have developed a fervent fascination for [Logotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy), a profound school of thought that explores the human search for meaning and purpose in life. My inquisitive mind leads me to explore the [schools of philosophy](https://bigthink.com/thinking/10-schools-of-philosophy-and-why-you-should-know-them/), as I endeavor to comprehend the intricacies of human belief systems and behavioral science. The intricate tapestry of human existence, woven with diverse threads of thought, beckons me to unravel its complexities.

 The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
