Albeit the title sounds like a story where an underserved college undergrad bags the coveted internship 
"accidentally": no, this is not about it.
<!-- 
The summer of 2023 was an exciting time to live in. The "academic comeback arc" ended since I finished all my courses, Futher, in the 8th semester my time-table was 
to sleep for 4 hours every night, wake up at 4 or 5am, work till afternoon, sleep for another 2-3 hours in the afternoon. It was wierd time in life. Particularly, 
this sleep schedule was the outcome of the necessity at the time- I needed to put on multiple simulations at a time. The never ending grind came to justice on 24th
 April when I submitted my first conference abstract to SISPAD. 

Around that time, en email popped up to all students advertising about Ph.D. positions available at IISC Banglore. I saw this as an opportunity to get exposed to 
another hot domain of research in semiconductors. I received a positive reply from the professor. I was happy to go to IISC, although my peers would appreciate 
coveted internships like MITACs and DAAD-WISE or any other foreign Univ intern more. Eventually I made in to Banglore, and seemed to like the weather coz it is 
not as sweaty as Mumbai. 

The internship started of weird since it was not a corporate intern, there was no HR onboarding or any introduction. I was informed that I would be given a researh 
topic that would be decent enough to get good results in 2 months- since it was not my first time working on experimental research. To my surprise almost everyone
in the cohort of co-interns was completing their second year of undergrad. In the first meeting I was told to work on designing a specific experiment concerning
memory devices, for which i would present the next week. The mentor assigned to me seemed pretty irresponsive, as I was tossed between 2-3 people having different
topics of interest for the remainder of two months. 


2 weeks passed. I could just read papers and no exposure to equipment training was provided. We had our first intern-presentation meeting. Other interns 
presented som literature review they were asked to. Funny enough, the postdoc (the "leader" of the cohort who we were supposed to report to) started asking 
the presenters questions on basic physics. The postdoc asked the numerical value of the thermal energy of electrons at room temperature to an intern, reverting their
 answers in a condescending way. Most of these interns had not even done a basic device physics course. I started to pity the postdoc who seemed to take pride in 
 knowing something seemingly more important than applying it. The setting was his grande dinner, where he hogged on curious amateurs to satisfy his ego appetite.
  Eventually I presented about the experiment I was told to look into. Since I had not designed an experiment like this before, I presented on whatever plan/ flow 
  I could gauge. Eyebrows raised in the room and I was asked to present a literature review. I looked at my mentor with a little surprised look. Clearly, I was  -->
