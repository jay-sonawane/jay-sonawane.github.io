It is human nature to cling to beliefs and certain belief systems. These belief systems are supposed to safeguard people against adversity in life. But the real interesting part comes when something challenges this belief system, and then it collapses. There are two possible future pathways; either you cling to another belief system, or your belief in belief systems collapses. This is the road to nihilism (the belief in nothing). Imagine yourself in such a situation where you dwell in rumination and conclude that these protective structures are flawed; they are themselves not to be trusted. Here you fall into an abyss of chaos and genuine aporia: should I feel protected by something, or should I be willing to confront such challenges without feeling that I’m being protected.

<!-- In the words of Dr. Jordan Peterson: “You could work your way through this, or resort to something coined as a “soul damaging move”: sacrifice your knowledge and re-identify with something rigid and restrictive.“ Further, he questions the existence of these “safe places“ and asks if you really want to be in a safe place. Quoting again, “Do you want to be so weak that you want to be protected from threat, paralyzed in a rabbit hole?” -->

Somewhere I read that in certain philosophies, the solution to the problem of tragedy lies in the willingness to face them. In this process, you grow, and you might grow larger than all this chaos one day.

In my opinion, expressing belief/disbelief in belief systems is paradoxical in itself since believing in nothing is a belief in itself. One may not engage in any belief system by reasoning that the collapse of the belief system might be more “soul damaging” than not believing in anything and accepting adversity in life. Certain philosophies like stoicism help/claim to help in misfortunes and how we can control their impact on us. Now, whether to stay protected or vulnerable, be dependent or independent, have faith in something else or yourself, dwell in a rabbit hole or fall into an abyss, is your call to make; the fact that tragedy isn’t controlled by us is sempiternal, yet how we react to this tragedy portrays how strong we are.
