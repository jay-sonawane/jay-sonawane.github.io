Albeit the title sounds like a story where an underserved college undergrad bags the coveted internship 
"accidentally": no, this is not about it.

The summer of 2023 was an exciting time to live in. The "academic comeback arc" ended since I finished all my courses, Futher, in the 8th semester my time-table was to sleep for 4 hours every night, wake up at 4 or 5am, work till afternoon, sleep for another 2-3 hours in the afternoon. It was wierd. I think this sleep schedule was the outcome of the necessity at the time- I needed to put multiple simulations at a time. All this grind came to an end on 24th April when I submitted my first conference paper to SISPAD. 

Around that time, en email popped up to all students advertising about Ph.D. positions available at IISC Banglore. I saw this as an opportunity to get exposed to another hot domain of research in semiconductors. I received a positive reply from the professor. I was happy to go to IISC, although my peers would appreciate coveted internships like MITACs and DAAD-WISE or any other foreign Univ intern more.
