The “academic comeback arc” ended since I finished all my courses, Futher, in the 8th semester my time-table was to sleep for 4 hours every night, wake up at 4 or 5am, work till afternoon, sleep for another 2-3 hours in the afternoon. It was wierd time in life. Particularly, this sleep schedule was the outcome of the necessity at the time- I needed to put on multiple simulations at a time. The never ending grind came to justice on 24th April when I submitted my first conference abstract to SISPAD.</p> <p>Around that time, en email popped up to all students advertising about Ph.D. positions available at IISC Banglore. I saw this as an opportunity to get exposed to another hot domain of research in semiconductors. I received a positive reply from the professor. I was happy to go to IISC, although my peers would appreciate coveted internships like MITACs and DAAD-WISE or any other foreign Univ intern more. Eventually I made in to Banglore, and seemed to like the weather coz it is not as sweaty as Mumbai.</p> <p>The internship started of weird since it was not a corporate intern, there was no HR onboarding or any introduction. I was informed that I would be given a researh topic that would be decent enough to get good results in 2 months- since it was not my first time working on experimental research. To my surprise almost everyone in the cohort of co-interns was completing their second year of undergrad. In the first meeting I was told to work on designing a specific experiment concerning memory devices, for which i would present the next week. The mentor assigned to me seemed pretty irresponsive, as I was tossed between 2-3 people having different topics of interest for the remainder of two months.</p> <p>2 weeks passed. I could just read papers and no exposure to equipment training was provided. We had our first intern-presentation meeting. Other interns presented som literature review they were asked to. Funny enough, the postdoc (the “leader” of the cohort who we were supposed to report to) started asking the presenters questions on basic physics. The postdoc asked the numerical value of the thermal energy of electrons at room temperature to an intern, reverting their answers in a condescending way. Most of these interns had not even done a basic device physics course. I started to pity the postdoc who seemed to take pride in knowing something seemingly more important than applying it. The setting was his grande dinner, where he hogged on curious amateurs to satisfy his ego appetite. Eventually I presented about the experiment I was told to look into. Since I had not designed an experiment like this before, I presented on whatever plan/ flow I could gauge. Eyebrows raised in the room and I was asked to present a literature review. I looked at my mentor with a little surprised look.

It was the summer post-2nd year of my undergraduate term. The spring ‘21 semester was the inflection point of a series of bad academic standing for the first three semesters, despite being interested in core electrical engineering. Confidence that had taken a death blow for 1.5 long years, finally surfaced, especially due to EE207 (electronic devices). I bagged a summer internship at Carnot Technologies, an agri-tech startup through the placement cell, around April ‘21. Little did I expect to get an intern through PT cell as my CPI was low, but I had done many projects in the hope of clutching the straws to compensate for bad academics. I got into Carnot chiefly because of a research project I did in the third semester (iSURP) based on hyperspectral image processing. April ‘21 was probably the happiest time of my life, getting an intern without even expecting as well as having a comeback from the academic downfall.</p> <p>So the universe had some other plans, it seems (no, I am not a pantheist, but it feels a little comfortable to address the “doer” of all the seemingly random yet organized events as the universe and not some single entity). Soon, in the second week of May, everything I considered the solid rock foundation of my belief system collapsed. The rest of 2021 can be summarised as biting the bullets, fighting adversity, and finding the right “Belief System” to sustain the newborn optimistic nihilist in me.</p> <p>I kept preparing for the upcoming intern season, did my intern work, and did a research project. Later in July, at the end of the internship, I was offered placement/ future intern/ open doors at Carnot for good work. All the division heads were invited to my presentation. It was a good day. The summer after the second year is an excellent time to think about what you want to do. The semiconductor industry was something I could see myself working in eventually (I can still see it). I spent time learning about the industry and studying what I like.</p> <p>In July, I prepared a little for the upcoming season and core was the only domain that I wanted to apply to. Texas Instruments was the first firm for core students. There was a test for shortlisting students for interview. I remember giving all intern tests, academic exams in a dilapidated state of mind but was sure that I’d do good. Texas Instruments shortlist came and there was no name in it. It had total 6-7 profiles, with some students getting shortlisted in multiple. There were electrical minor students shortlisted too (although no one got selected eventually). Just the fact that I wasn’t even shortlisted was pretty heavy to digest. Stoicism consumed me enough to not pay heed to whatever was going on. Over the complete semester, I was shortlisted in 0 firms. It is actually a throw of a die in intern season, many people don’t get what they want. So everyone eventually applies everywhere and gets an intern usually. The fact is if you don’t apply, you are not going to get selected, for surely. I was adamant on interning in core so applied to only core profiles and wanted to go to Texas/ Qualcomm/ Samsung Semiconductor (PS: The only companies that take DD students as interns).</p> <p>My plan was to do research under a professor at IITB otherwise, since I had this hint that I would be wanting to go for grad school eventually. I was already doing in-semester research and focused on improving how the transcript would look 2 years down the lane. Thinking that my grades were too ugly to get selected for a Univ intern or industry intern through apping, I didn’t apply anywhere except AMD and Intel (got no reply; AMD replied after a year :D offering a full time position thinking I must have graduated). Post Samsung semiconductor that came in October, I didn’t open the internship blog. So summer project was the plan.</p> <p>Fast forward to April ‘22, when the best semester ended, I had recovered in academics in three semesters after the first three semesters. I had this fomo that everyone else was going to do an internship, whereas I would be doing research. I contacted my second year intern mentor Yash, to ask if I could continue again at Carnot. After a brief call with him, I got to know he had left Carnot 6 months prior and was at Atomberg. He asked me to send my resume. I had an interview and was selected for a sensors/ embedded RnD role, around May 10.</p> <p>So, a second year iSURP project led to a second year intern, and second year intern led to a third-year intern (ended up working with Yash again, eventually!). No shortlist in third-year intern rendered me to give importance to the thought of going to a grad school. In the end, I ended up doing a core intern as well as research with professor, which was the exact thing I wanted to do a year back then.</p> <p>My colleagues at Atomberg were the best one could wish for. We used to make fun of someone being the favored intern and someone neglected. Towards the end of the internship, everyone’s mentor discussed about PPO with their mentees informally, except me. We joked that I was “The Accidental Intern”, hence I am not granted a privilege as others (the real reason was that the HR said no PPO for DD).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="links"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[march & april, looking forward to life]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Belief Systems</title><link href="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/belief_systems/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Belief Systems"/><published>2022-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/belief_systems</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/belief_systems/"><![CDATA[<p>It is human nature to cling to beliefs and certain belief systems. These belief systems are supposed to safeguard people against adversity in life. But the real interesting part comes when something challenges this belief system, and then it collapses. There are two possible future pathways; either you cling to another belief system, or your belief in belief systems collapses. This is the road to nihilism (the belief in nothing). Imagine yourself in such a situation where you dwell in rumination and conclude that these protective structures are flawed; they are themselves not to be trusted. Here you fall into an abyss of chaos and genuine aporia: should I feel protected by something, or should I be willing to confront such challenges without feeling that I’m being protected.</p> <p>Somewhere I read that in certain philosophies, the solution to the problem of tragedy lies in the willingness to face them. In this process, you grow, and you might grow larger than all this chaos one day.</p> <p>In my opinion, expressing belief/disbelief in belief systems is paradoxical in itself since believing in nothing is a belief in itself. One may not engage in any belief system by reasoning that the collapse of the belief system might be more “soul damaging” than not believing in anything and accepting adversity in life. Certain philosophies like stoicism help/claim to help in misfortunes and how we can control their impact on us. Now, whether to stay protected or vulnerable, be dependent or independent, have faith in something else or yourself, dwell in a rabbit hole or fall into an abyss, is your call to make; the fact that tragedy isn’t controlled by us is sempiternal, yet how we react to this tragedy portrays how strong we are.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="links"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[march & april, looking forward to life]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
