It was the summer post-2nd year of my undergraduate term. The spring ‘21 semester was the inflection point of a series of bad academic standing for the first three semesters, despite being interested in core electrical engineering. Confidence that had taken a death blow for 1.5 long years, finally surfaced, especially due to EE207 (electronic devices). I bagged a summer internship at Carnot Technologies, an agri-tech startup through the placement cell, around April ‘21. Little did I expect to get an intern through PT cell as my CPI was low, but I had done many projects in the hope of clutching the straws to compensate for bad academics. I got into Carnot chiefly because of a research project I did in the third semester (iSURP) based on hyperspectral image processing. April ‘21 was probably the happiest time of my life, getting an intern without even expecting as well as having a comeback from the academic downfall.</p> <p>So the universe had some other plans, it seems (no, I am not a pantheist, but it feels a little comfortable to address the “doer” of all the seemingly random yet organized events as the universe and not some single entity). Soon, in the second week of May, everything I considered the solid rock foundation of my belief system collapsed. The rest of 2021 can be summarised as biting the bullets, fighting adversity, and finding the right “Belief System” to sustain the newborn optimistic nihilist in me.</p> <p>I kept preparing for the upcoming intern season, did my intern work, and did a research project. Later in July, at the end of the internship, I was offered placement/ future intern/ open doors at Carnot for good work. All the division heads were invited to my presentation. It was a good day. The summer after the second year is an excellent time to think about what you want to do. The semiconductor industry was something I could see myself working in eventually (I can still see it). I spent time learning about the industry and studying what I like.</p> <p>In July, I prepared a little for the upcoming season and core was the only domain that I wanted to apply to. Texas Instruments was the first firm for core students. There was a test for shortlisting students for interview. I remember giving all intern tests, academic exams in a dilapidated state of mind but was sure that I’d do good. Texas Instruments shortlist came and there was no name in it. It had total 6-7 profiles, with some students getting shortlisted in multiple. There were electrical minor students shortlisted too (although no one got selected eventually). Just the fact that I wasn’t even shortlisted was pretty heavy to digest. Stoicism consumed me enough to not pay heed to whatever was going on. Over the complete semester, I was shortlisted in 0 firms. It is actually a throw of a die in intern season, many people don’t get what they want. So everyone eventually applies everywhere and gets an intern usually. The fact is if you don’t apply, you are not going to get selected, for surely. I was adamant on interning in core so applied to only core profiles and wanted to go to Texas/ Qualcomm/ Samsung Semiconductor (PS: The only companies that take DD students as interns).</p> <p>My plan was to do research under a professor at IITB otherwise, since I had this hint that I would be wanting to go for grad school eventually. I was already doing in-semester research and focused on improving how the transcript would look 2 years down the lane. Thinking that my grades were too ugly to get selected for a Univ intern or industry intern through apping, I didn’t apply anywhere except AMD and Intel (got no reply; AMD replied after a year :D offering a full time position thinking I must have graduated). Post Samsung semiconductor that came in October, I didn’t open the internship blog. So summer project was the plan.</p> <p>Fast forward to April ‘22, when the best semester ended, I had recovered in academics in three semesters after the first three semesters. I had this fomo that everyone else was going to do an internship, whereas I would be doing research. I contacted my second year intern mentor Yash, to ask if I could continue again at Carnot. After a brief call with him, I got to know he had left Carnot 6 months prior and was at Atomberg. He asked me to send my resume. I had an interview and was selected for a sensors/ embedded RnD role, around May 10.</p> <p>So, a second year iSURP project led to a second year intern, and second year intern led to a third-year intern (ended up working with Yash again, eventually!). No shortlist in third-year intern rendered me to give importance to the thought of going to a grad school. In the end, I ended up doing a core intern as well as research with professor, which was the exact thing I wanted to do a year back then.</p> <p>My colleagues at Atomberg were the best one could wish for. We used to make fun of someone being the favored intern and someone neglected. Towards the end of the internship, everyone’s mentor discussed about PPO with their mentees informally, except me. We joked that I was “The Accidental Intern”, hence I am not granted a privilege as others (the real reason was that the HR said no PPO for DD).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="links"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[march & april, looking forward to life]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">a post with jupyter notebook</title><link href="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2023/jupyter-notebook/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a post with jupyter notebook"/><published>2023-07-04T12:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-04T12:57:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2023/jupyter-notebook</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2023/jupyter-notebook/"><![CDATA[<p>To include a jupyter notebook in a post, you can use the following code:</p> <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
    {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s break it down: this is possible thanks to <a href="https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook">Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin</a> that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls <a href="https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jupyter nbconvert --to html</code></a> to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/">Kramdown</a> is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions">::nomarkdown</a> tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.</p> <p>The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file_exists</code> filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:</p> <div class="jupyter-notebook" style="position: relative; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="jupyter-notebook-iframe-container"> <iframe src="/assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb.html" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; border-style: none;" width="100%" height="100%" onload="this.parentElement.style.paddingBottom = (this.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight + 10) + 'px'"></iframe> </div> </div> <p>Note that the jupyter notebook supports both light and dark themes.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="jupyter"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[an example of a blog post with jupyter notebook]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Belief Systems</title><link href="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/belief_systems/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Belief Systems"/><published>2022-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/belief_systems</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/belief_systems/"><![CDATA[<p>It is human nature to cling to beliefs and certain belief systems. These belief systems are supposed to safeguard people against adversity in life. But the real interesting part comes when something challenges this belief system, and then it collapses. There are two possible future pathways; either you cling to another belief system, or your belief in belief systems collapses. This is the road to nihilism (the belief in nothing). Imagine yourself in such a situation where you dwell in rumination and conclude that these protective structures are flawed; they are themselves not to be trusted. Here you fall into an abyss of chaos and genuine aporia: should I feel protected by something, or should I be willing to confront such challenges without feeling that I’m being protected.</p> <p>Somewhere I read that in certain philosophies, the solution to the problem of tragedy lies in the willingness to face them. In this process, you grow, and you might grow larger than all this chaos one day.</p> <p>In my opinion, expressing belief/disbelief in belief systems is paradoxical in itself since believing in nothing is a belief in itself. One may not engage in any belief system by reasoning that the collapse of the belief system might be more “soul damaging” than not believing in anything and accepting adversity in life. Certain philosophies like stoicism help/claim to help in misfortunes and how we can control their impact on us. Now, whether to stay protected or vulnerable, be dependent or independent, have faith in something else or yourself, dwell in a rabbit hole or fall into an abyss, is your call to make; the fact that tragedy isn’t controlled by us is sempiternal, yet how we react to this tragedy portrays how strong we are.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="formatting"/><category term="links"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[march & april, looking forward to life]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">a distill-style blog post</title><link href="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2021/distill/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="a distill-style blog post"/><published>2021-05-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-05-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2021/distill</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jay-sonawane.github.io/blog/2021/distill/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="equations">Equations</h2> <p>This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax 3</a> engine. You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="citations">Citations</h2> <p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag. The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography. The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.</p> <p>The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote></p> <hr/> <h2 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h2> <p>Syntax highlighting is provided within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> tags. An example of inline code snippets: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code language="html"&gt;let x = 10;&lt;/d-code&gt;</code>. For larger blocks of code, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block</code> attribute:</p> <d-code block="" language="javascript"> var x = 25; function(x) { return x * x; } </d-code> <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> blocks do not look good in the dark mode. You can always use the default code-highlight using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlight</code> liquid tag:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">;</span>
